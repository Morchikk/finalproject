            <h3>Arch Motorcycle is a luxury American motorcycle</h3>
            <p>
              manufacturer based in Hawthorne, California. The company was
              founded in 2011 by actor Keanu Reeves and bike designer Gard
              Hollinger
            </p>

            </p>

              The partnership first creation is this KR GT1 prototype that you
              can see below being ridden by Keanu Reeves. The actor visited for
              the 1st time Gard in 2007 at his L.A. County Choprods shop for a
              customizing job on one of his favorite rides. That led to a
              friendship and an ongoing dialogue about riding the ideal machine.
              Both sharing the same passion for life on two wheels, having
              common design taste and preference for performance motorcycles,
              they decided to collaborate under the brand name of Arch
              Motorcycle Company on a first prototype named the KR GT1s
              characterized by its power, stability, agility, and aesthetic
              beauty, offering smooth and impressive power in addition to a
              comfortable ride. This first prototype is the result of a
              five-year collaboration with the goal of building a custom
              motorcycle focused on its ride-ability. A bike begging to be
              ridden. <br />
              Reeves, an avid motorcycle enthusiast has been quietly enjoying
              motorcycles for more than 25 years. Whether rain or shine, he
              rides daily and has even had long stints where he didn’t own a car
              and relied solely on two-wheeled forms of transportation. His
              passion for motorcycles dates back to his youth. His first ride
              was a Kawasaki 600 Enduro and he currently owns a variety of
              Norton Commandos as well as the first Arch Motorcycle. “I’m a guy
              that loves everything about motorcycles – the sounds, the style
              and the aesthetic combined with the function but most of all the
              riding experience. I’ve enjoyed motorcycles for as long as I can
              remember and I’m ready to share my passion with the world,”
              explains Reeves
